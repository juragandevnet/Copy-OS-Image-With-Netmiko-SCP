I create this script to help me copy Cisco IOS Images to thousand devices in just 1 enter.
It was tested in 1 of the biggest bank in singapore.

You must enable "ip scp server enable" on the device.
Make sure the IOS/OS name is similar with IOS/OS Image you want to copy from PC/server to network devices. change it if required.
Make sure the script and the IOS/OS Image is in the same folder.
